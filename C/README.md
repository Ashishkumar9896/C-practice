## 🚀 Getting Started

Each directory contains:
- C source files (`.c`)
- Compiled executables (`.exe`) alongside their source files
- Individual README.md with specific explanations

## 📖 How to Use

1. Navigate to any specific directory based on the concept you want to learn
2. Read the README.md in that directory for an overview
3. Study the C source files for implementation examples
4. Compile and run the programs to see them in action

## 🔧 Compilation

Use GCC to compile any program:
```bash
gcc filename.c -o filename.exe
```

Then run:
```bash
./filename.exe
```
